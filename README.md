# Windward Financial CRM & Public Website

Deployed on Railway

A full-stack application for **Windward Financial**, a Hawaiʻi-based insurance and retirement planning brokerage serving public employees (DOE teachers, state workers, city & county employees).

The system has **two frontends** sharing **one backend**:

- **Public Website** (`packages/public`) — Astro static site replacing the existing windward.financial Squarespace site. Pages, testimonials, and team bios live as Markdown in the repo (Astro Content Collections); upcoming events are queried from Postgres at build time. Every form submission still creates a lead in the CRM via the API.
- **Admin CRM** (`packages/web`) — Internal React + Vite tool for the 5-person team to manage contacts, pipeline, policies, communications, automation, and events.
- **API** (`packages/api`) — Node.js/Express backend serving the admin CRM and the public site's form submissions.

> **Content editing for non-developers — pending decision.** Until a CMS is wired up, content edits require a Markdown PR. Decap CMS is the likely default; this is intentionally deferred so the team can pick one tool once the new site is live.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+** (local or Docker)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
cd packages/api && npm install
cd ../web && npm install
cd ../public && npm install
```

### 2. Set up the database

Create a PostgreSQL database and user:

```sql
CREATE USER windward WITH PASSWORD 'windward' CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE windward_crm OWNER windward;
```

Or if using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name windward-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=windward \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=windward \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=windward_crm \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16-alpine
```

### 3. Configure environment

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example packages/api/.env
```

The default `.env` works for local development with the database credentials above.

### 4. Run migrations and seed data

```bash
cd packages/api
npm run db:migrate    # Creates the 15 CRM tables + 3 ops tables (+ marketing module)
npm run db:seed       # Populates sample CRM data
```

The seed script creates:
- 7 admin/agent users
- 30 sample contacts across all pipeline stages and islands
- 2 events
- 6-email nurture drip sequence templates
- 8 sample policies, 10 tasks, 15 activity log entries

Pages, testimonials, and team bios are no longer in the database — they live as Markdown in `packages/public/src/content/`.

### 5. Start all services

Open three terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API (port 3001)
cd packages/api && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Public website (port 5174)
cd packages/public && npm run dev

# Terminal 3 — Admin CRM (port 5173)
cd packages/web && npm run dev
```

### 6. Open in browser

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Public Website | http://localhost:5174 | No login required |
| Admin CRM | http://localhost:5173 | Requires login |
| API Health Check | http://localhost:3001/api/health | Returns `{"status":"ok"}` |

### Default login credentials

| User | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Herb Hussey (Admin) | `herb@windwardfinancial.net` | `windward2024` |
| Kealaka'i Hussey (Agent) | `kealakai@windwardfinancial.net` | `windward2024` |
| Admin User | `admin@windwardfinancial.net` | `admin123` |

## Public Website Pages

The public site at `packages/public` is an Astro static site replacing the existing Squarespace site. Page text, testimonials, and team bios are Markdown files in `packages/public/src/content/`. Upcoming events are queried from Postgres at build time. Page loads issue zero database queries for content reads.

10 page types (12 total routes — `events/[id].astro` generates one route per upcoming event):

| Route | Page | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| `/` | Home | `content/pages/home.md` + testimonials collection |
| `/about` | About | `content/pages/about.md` + team collection |
| `/expertise` | Expertise | `content/pages/expertise.md` |
| `/quality-commitment` | Quality Commitment | `content/pages/quality-commitment.md` |
| `/contact` | Contact | Static + React form island |
| `/schedule-an-appointment` | Schedule | Static + React form island |
| `/events` | Events | Postgres query at build time |
| `/events/:id` | Event Detail | Postgres query at build time + React registration form |
| `/calculator` | Calculator | React calculator island |
| `/enroll` | Enroll | Static + React form island |
| `/national-life-transition` | NLG Transition | `content/pages/national-life-transition.md` |
| `/resources` | Resources | `content/pages/resources.md` |

**Every form submission on the public site automatically:**
1. Creates or updates a contact in the CRM
2. Sets the pipeline stage to "New Lead"
3. Sets the appropriate lead source
4. Fires automation rules (welcome email, agent task)

---

## Admin CRM Pages

The admin CRM at `packages/web` is the internal tool for managing the business.

| Route | Page | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/` | Dashboard | Pipeline stats, Kanban overview, recent activity, tasks due today |
| `/contacts` | Contacts | Searchable, filterable contact table with bulk actions |
| `/contacts/:id` | Contact Detail | Full profile, activity timeline, policies, tasks, quick actions |
| `/pipeline` | Pipeline | Full-screen drag-and-drop Kanban board (9 stages) |
| `/tasks` | Tasks | My Tasks / All Tasks with priority, type, and due date filters |
| `/templates` | Templates | Email template editor with merge tags and preview |
| `/sequences` | Sequences | Visual drip sequence builder with delay configuration |
| `/appointments` | Appointments | Calendar and list view of scheduled consultations |
| `/communications` | Communications | Unified inbox: calls and SMS messages from Quo |
| `/events` | Events | List, create, edit, delete events; view registrations per event. Triggers public-site rebuild on save. |
| `/reports` | Reports | Pipeline funnel, lead sources, agent activity, revenue |
| `/settings` | Settings | User management, SMTP, Quo API integration |
| `/marketing/*` | Marketing | District outreach, drip campaigns, webinars, ads (separate module) |

### Pipeline Stages

Contacts move through 9 stages, each triggering automated actions:

```
New Lead → Contacted → Consultation Scheduled → Consultation Completed
→ Proposal Sent → Application Submitted → Policy Issued → Active Client
                                                            ↘ Lost / Not Now
```

---

## Database Schema

15 core CRM tables + 3 operations / observability tables (`job_runs`,
`webhook_events`, `lead_score_history`) managed by Drizzle ORM. The marketing
module adds its own additional tables; Postgres-side count is higher.

**CRM Core (7):**
- `users` — Agents and admins (3 roles: admin, agent, viewer)
- `contacts` — Leads and clients with employment, financial, and insurance data
- `pipeline_entries` — Pipeline stage history (each contact has one active entry)
- `policies` — Insurance and annuity products sold to contacts
- `tasks` — Assigned action items with priority and due dates
- `activities` — Timeline log of all interactions per contact
- `appointments` — Scheduled consultations

**Email (2):**
- `email_templates` — Reusable templates with merge tags (`{{first_name}}`, etc.)
- `email_queue` — Scheduled outbound emails processed every 5 minutes

**Phone/SMS / Quo (3):**
- `quo_phone_numbers` — Cached workspace phone numbers
- `call_logs` — Inbound/outbound calls with recordings and transcriptions
- `sms_messages` — Text message history

**Events (3):**
- `events` — Webinars and seminars
- `event_registrations` — Event attendee registrations
- `newsletter_subscribers` — Email list with source tracking

> **Removed in this refactor:** `blog_posts`, `site_pages`, `testimonials`,
> `team_members` (see `migrations/0003_drop_cms_and_blog.sql`). Pages,
> testimonials, and team bios now live as Markdown in
> `packages/public/src/content/`.

## API Endpoints

### Public API (no authentication)

These endpoints accept form submissions from the static public site, plus the events read endpoints (also used by Astro at build time):

---

## Operations Dashboard

Admin-only suite that surfaces the health of the Quo integration, the AI
lead-scoring system, and every cron / background task. Three pages live under
`/operations/*` and are visible in the sidebar only when `user.role === 'admin'`.

- **Quo Status** (`/operations/quo`) — API key state, last/next sync, webhook
  registration map (3/4 registered), 24-hour received/processed/error/unmatched
  counters, and a paginated webhook activity feed with row-level JSON payload
  drawer. "Sync Now" kicks a manual `quo-sync` job and polls until it lands.
- **Lead Scoring** (`/operations/leads`) — total / hot / average score / auto-booked
  KPIs, a 10-bucket distribution histogram (click a bucket to filter), filterable
  leads table with score badge + Δ vs previous run, and a per-contact drawer
  showing the factor-by-factor contribution breakdown plus a sparkline of recent
  scores. A collapsible run history shows the last 30 lead-scoring jobs.
- **Automation Activity** (`/operations/automation`) — three tabs:
  - *Email Queue* — pending / sent / failed / oldest counters, filterable list,
    per-row Retry, and bulk "Retry all failed today".
  - *Stage Automation* — chronological list of pipeline transitions with the
    side-effects (queued emails, notes, etc.) that fired alongside each one.
  - *Background Jobs* — 30-day per-job heatmap (green/amber/red) plus a
    filterable runs table with full log + error in a side drawer.

Lead-score updates no longer pollute the activity feed. The score, previous
score, factor breakdown, and originating job-run are all written to the new
`lead_score_history` table; the dashboard reads from there. Cron-triggered
runs and manual "Sync Now" runs both flow through `runJob()`, which writes a
row to `job_runs` (status `running` → `success`/`partial`/`failed`).

---

## Automation Engine

The system automates the majority of the sales pipeline. Only two steps require human intervention: the licensed agent consultation and the application signing.

### Stage-Change Automations

When a contact's pipeline stage changes, the automation engine (`services/automation.ts`) fires:

| Stage | Automated Actions |
|-------|-------------------|
| **→ New Lead** | Enroll in 6-email nurture drip sequence, send welcome SMS, score lead |
| **→ Consultation Scheduled** | Send confirmation email + SMS, schedule reminders, create prep task |
| **→ Consultation Completed** | Generate AI product recommendation, create review task |
| **→ Proposal Sent** | Queue follow-ups at 3, 5, and 10 days; auto-expire to Lost after 14 days |
| **→ Application Submitted** | Send confirmation email |
| **→ Policy Issued** | Send congrats, queue 90-day check-in, annual review, referral request |
| **→ Lost / Not Now** | Queue re-engagement emails at 90 and 180 days |

### Background Cron Jobs

| Schedule | Job |
|----------|-----|
| Every 5 min | Process email queue |
| Every 5 min | Process marketing campaign queue |
| Every 15 min | Sync Quo calls and messages |
| Daily 8am HST | Renewal reminders, annual reviews, birthday emails |
| Daily 9am HST | Re-score all leads, auto-book hot leads |
| Daily midnight HST | Expire stale proposals (>14 days → Lost) |
| Monthly 1st 6am HST | Generate performance report |

### AI Lead Scoring

Every lead is scored 0–100 based on:
- Employment type (DOE Teachers score highest)
- Years of service
- Life insurance status (None = high opportunity)
- Lead source quality (Calculator, Referral = high intent)
- Data completeness (salary, 403b balance provided)

Hot leads (≥70) are fast-tracked to auto-schedule consultations.

### AI Product Recommendations

After a consultation is marked complete, Claude generates a draft recommendation covering:
- Recommended products (from 7 available types)
- Rationale for each recommendation
- Estimated monthly cost
- Projected retirement income impact

The agent reviews and adjusts before sending the proposal.

## Quo (OpenPhone) Integration

The CRM integrates with [Quo](https://www.openphone.com/) for business phone and SMS:

- **Inbound call/SMS logging** — Webhook receivers auto-create activity entries on matching contacts
- **Outbound SMS** — Send texts from within the CRM contact detail page
- **Call recordings and transcriptions** — Synced and displayed on the contact timeline
- **AI call summaries** — Auto-generated summaries from Quo's AI
- **Phone number management** — Map Quo numbers to CRM agents

### Setup

1. Get your Quo API key from the Quo dashboard
2. Add it to `QUO_API_KEY` in your `.env`
3. In the Admin CRM → Settings → Quo Integration: click "Test Connection" then "Register Webhooks"
4. Assign Quo phone numbers to agents in the mapping table

## Docker Deployment

For production deployment on a VPS:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts 5 services:
- **postgres** — PostgreSQL 16 with persistent volume
- **api** — Express server (runs migrations on startup)
- **web** — Admin CRM (nginx serving built React app)
- **public** — Public website (nginx serving Astro static `dist/`)
- **nginx** — Reverse proxy routing:
  - Port 80 (windward.financial) → public site
  - Port 8080 (admin.windward.financial) → admin CRM
  - `/api/*` → backend API (both domains)

### Railway Deployment

The app is also designed for Railway:
- **API** → Web service (Node.js, port from `$PORT`)
- **Public** → Static site (Astro build output, `packages/public/dist`)
- **Admin** → Static site (Vite build output, `packages/web/dist`)
- **PostgreSQL** → Railway managed Postgres

#### Auto-deploy from GitHub

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` watches `main`, diffs the push, and runs
`railway up` for whichever of `packages/{api,public,web}` changed. A change to
the workflow file or root `package*.json` redeploys all three. Manual deploys
are also available via the **Actions** tab → "Deploy to Railway" → Run workflow,
with `service: api|public|web|all` and `action: up|redeploy|logs`.

Required GitHub secret: `RAILWAY_TOKEN` — an account token from
[https://railway.com/account/tokens](https://railway.com/account/tokens). The
project ID is hardcoded in the workflow (`RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` env).

#### Required Railway environment variables

Set these directly on each Railway service (Settings → Variables) — the
workflow does not push them.

**API service:**
- `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, plus the SMTP / Quo / Anthropic vars from
  `.env.example`
- `PUBLIC_URL`, `ADMIN_URL` for CORS
- `REBUILD_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional) — usually a Railway redeploy webhook for the
  public service so admin event edits trigger a rebuild

**Public service:**
- `PUBLIC_API_URL` — base URL the Astro forms post to (e.g.
  `https://api.windward.financial`)
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — canonical site URL (used for sitemap)
- `PUBLIC_NLG_LOGIN_URL` — National Life Group customer login URL
- `BUILD_DATABASE_URL` — read-only Postgres role used at build time to query
  upcoming events. **Build still succeeds when unset** (events page renders
  empty), so previews without DB access don't break.

**Admin service:**
- `VITE_API_URL` — base URL the admin posts to
